API must contain the following endpoints:

1. write an endpoint which takes an ID and returns all info on the Pokemon with that Pokedex number
2. write an endpoint which takes a name and returns all info on the Pokemon with that name.
3. Write CRUD operations.

Key Points:
1. Code must be in Python, but can use any API framework. 
2. The app is only allowed to make a single call to the apl at startup to obtain the dataset and cannot make a call for that dataset each time it receives a request.
3. Any solution for this is allowed, and we can discuss other possibilities you might consider if taking more time to build this.
